# ADRates

**ADRates** is a modern, Python‚Äêbased library for building Overnight Index Swap (OIS) discount curves and computing sensitivities (delta and gamma) of interest rate swaps via Automatic Differentiation (AD).

## üöÄ Features

- **Robust OIS Curve Construction**  
  Flexible bootstrapping routines for building arbitrage‚Äêfree discount and forward curves from market quotes.

- **Automatic Differentiation of Greeks**  
  Compute first‚Äêorder (delta) and second‚Äêorder (gamma) sensitivities of swap PVs directly via AD, without finite‚Äêdifference approximations.

- **Modern API & Performance**  
  Designed for JAX integration, enabling vectorized, just-in-time compilation and GPU acceleration.

- **Round-Trip Curve Consistency**  
  Build discount and forward curves that reproduce input swap rates exactly, ensuring theoretical consistency.

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ludcode/ADRates.git
cd ADRates
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Verify installation

Run the unit tests to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Usage Example (if you have a Bloomberg Terminal)

```python
from cavour.models.models import Model
model = Model(value_dt=date.Date(30, 4, 2024))
model.prebuilt_curve("GBP_OIS_SONIA")
```
